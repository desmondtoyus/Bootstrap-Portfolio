					<div class="aboutme-p">
					<p>My earliest school memory was of myself in a classroom in northern Nigeria with no chairs, pupils about my age (3 or 4) all sat on the bare floor, the classroom had no windows and the roof was leaking. When it rained, though it rarely rains in northern Nigeria, we would all cluster around the portion of the classroom where the roof was leaking the least.
					<p>Some of my favorite childish play with other kids included, rolling used car tires down the street, rain dancing and Sallah Ram fighting. People would gather to watch rams fight before the Muslim eid-kabir festival. That was before a religious violence erupted and the family relocated south- south is majorly Christians.</p>
					<p>Southern Nigeria was more developed, the people were more educated and civilized. The streets were usually untarred and dust rising with every passing car, the houses had rusted brown roofs. Almost every house had a tall fence with a large gate and a mini shop beside it, where petty stuffs were sold. Every street had a make shift football (soccer) pitch where kids with torn clothes play football. </p>
